# Cost-Effective-Data-Storage-in-Edge-Storage-System-using-Erasure-Code
I've engineered a cutting-edge project titled "Cost-Effective Data Placement in Edge Storage Systems" utilizing erasure code techniques. This innovative solution optimizes storage costs by implementing efficient data placement strategies within edge storage systems. By harnessing erasure code, the project achieves impressive savings of up to 68.58% in storage costs compared to traditional storage methods. This project not only showcases my expertise in storage optimization but also underscores my commitment to leveraging advanced technologies to address real-world challenges.
